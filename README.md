# Forecasting-Popularity-in-Digital-Journalism

Online news articles that have a high popularity score are more likely to be shared and commented on by the readers. The popularity of online news articles depends on many factors, such as the topic, the headline, the keywords, the images, and the text quality. A model that can predict the popularity of an article before it is published can be very useful for media professionals who want to create engaging and relevant content for their audience.

Furthermore, we take pride in highlighting our notable performance in the literature, particularly within non-deep learning architectures. Our commitment extends towards future explorations in this domain, along with analysis of prevailing and emergent high-impact trends on top of popularity prediction..
